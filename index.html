    <h2>1️⃣ Property Strategy</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Buy to Build, Not Lease to Limit.</span> Our goal is to create a lasting legacy — a premium venue that delivers long-term value and unmatched experiences. Ownership grants us full creative and operational freedom.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Secluded yet reachable, designed for guests to feel like they’ve stepped into another world.</li>
      <li><strong>Style:</strong> Rustic modern ranch with expansive lawns, scenic views, and architectural charm.</li>
      <li><strong>Exclusivity:</strong> We host one event at a time — creating a stress-free, private, and personalized environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Hours:</strong> Late-night license ensures parties don’t need to stop early — venues closing at 12 AM are no match.</li>
      <li><strong>Parking:</strong> On-site parking for 100+ vehicles and valet service options.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2️⃣ Target Events</h2>
    <p>We cater to a diverse set of clientele — from high-energy celebrations to professional gatherings:</p>
